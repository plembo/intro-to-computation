# Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python
Code and notes from working through the book:

John V. Guttag. _Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python_. 3rd ed., MIT Press, 2021.

This is a terrific book for learning computer science concepts through
python programming. Professor Guttag a great teacher and provides clear,
concise examples for the concepts being taught.

I am finding the "finger exercises" (small problems that are supposed to
test understanding of the concepts being taught and some practical
experience with them) doubly challenging because I have virtually none of
the math that they assume (I never got past sophmore geometry in high
school -- and although I passed, probably shouldn't have). But it's important
stuff to know, so I'm pushing through.

Because I'm focused on learning the concepts, I'm shamelessly trawling the
Internet for answers. So far, I've found that people on StackOverflow really
like computer science puzzles. Of course they do. Surprisingly, many of them
also have a knack for teaching as well.

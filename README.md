# Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python
Code and notes from working through the book:

John V. Guttag. _Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python_. 3rd ed., MIT Press, 2021.

This is a terrific book for learning computer science concepts through
python programming.

I am finding the "finger exercises" (small problems that are supposed to
test understanding of the concepts being taught and some practical
experience with them) doubly challenging because I have virtually none of
the math that they assume (I never got past sophmore geometry in high
school -- and although I passed, probably shouldn't have). But it's important
stuff to know, so I'm pushing through.
